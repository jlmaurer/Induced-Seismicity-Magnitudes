# Induced-Seismicity-Magnitudes
This repository accompanies the manuscript "Magnitudes of Induced Earthquakes in Low-Stress Environments," submitted to BSSA. 
The repository contains a set of scripts that reproduce the plots contained in the paper, along with the necessary accompanying functions for computing the solutions given in the paper for the distribution of earthquake magnitudes whose rupture areas are constrained within some perturbed volume. 
The scripts are named by the figure they reproduce.
